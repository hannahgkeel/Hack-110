<h1>Project Spec</h1>
<p>The Floor is Lava!</p>
<p>In this game, your job is to help Kanye’s head bounce along the pillows which will be floating on lava. Avoid touching lava and Kim’s incoming heads to stay alive!</p>
<p> Matthew Still, Hannah Keel</p>
<p>We used classes, alerts, arrays, loops, various functions, and importing. The classes and arrays allowed us to define the incoming pillows and Kim heads which both have their own conditional if statements. The alerts allow us to give directions to the player prior to the start of the game, as well as load an end-of-game screen. Loops allowed us to create numerous pillows and Kim heads and make them move across the screen.
   We learned a lot about sprites and the many implications for them. It was hard for us initially to create isColliding conditionals in order to define when Kanye’s head was hitting the lava, pillows, or Kim’s head. We also learned about the use of ticker, and used that to change the pillows x coordinates along the screen.</p>

<p>Matthew Still: I imported the background as well as the individual images seen in our app. I had to crop each of the images so they would have a small enough contact zone to not have Kanye touching a pillow / lava / Kim from a distance away. Additionally, I created the classes and implemented the change in x coordinates of the sprites. I also worked on the isColliding conditions, allowing different results from Kanye touching the different objects in our app. </p>
<p> Hannah Keel: I was responsible for scaling the imported images and ensuring the layout was smooth. We wanted to have the pillows seem as if they were floating on the lava. Additionally, the start point of Kanye’s head was important as it had to start above the pillows but below the Kim heads. I also worked on the movement of Kanye, using the keyboardevent seen in the code. We decided to only use spacebar and have the pillows move underneath to create a more challenging game environment. </p>
<p>We were excited to see the result of our final project. The isColliding and implications of sprites were a large hurdle for us at the beginning. Overcoming these was definitely one of our goals and we were very happy to have done it. Seeing code in a different environment than we were used to gave us a better perspective on the vast applications of coding and a small snapshot into what can be created from nothing.
   We would like to incorporate a score ticker that would increase as Kanye survives along the pillows. Additionally, we thought about adding more obstacles for him to overcome.
